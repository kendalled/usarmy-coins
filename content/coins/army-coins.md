# Army Challenge Coins

Custom challenge coins for the United States Army, America's oldest and largest military service branch. Our Army challenge coins honor nearly 250 years of service from the Continental Army's formation in 1775 through today's modern ground forces. These coins celebrate the dedication, sacrifice, and warrior ethos of soldiers who serve as the backbone of America's defense.

## Distinguished Army Challenge Coin Tradition

The United States Army has the longest and most storied tradition of challenge coins among all military branches. From the Revolutionary War to modern conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, Army challenge coins have served as symbols of unit pride, camaraderie, and achievement. The Army's challenge coin tradition embodies the seven core values: Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless Service, Honor, Integrity, and Personal Courage.

Army challenge coins serve multiple purposes within the service. Company commanders present coins to recognize outstanding performance, mission accomplishments, and acts of valor. Battalion and brigade commanders use challenge coins to build unit cohesion and acknowledge exceptional service. These coins are also exchanged during formal ceremonies, including NCO inductions, promotion ceremonies, change of command events, and retirement celebrations.

## Authentic Army Design Elements and Symbolism

Our Army challenge coins incorporate authentic military symbology that reflects the rich heritage of ground warfare. Popular design elements include the Army star with its distinctive five-pointed design, unit crests that tell the story of each unit's history, distinctive unit insignia (DUI) that identify specific regiments and battalions, and branch insignia representing different military occupational specialties.

The traditional Army colors of black and gold dominate many designs, often accented with unit-specific colors and historical significance. Three-dimensional relief work brings equipment details to life, while precision engraving captures unit mottos, campaign honors, and battle streamers. Special finishes include antique bronze for historical units, polished gold for command coins, and dual-tone plating for modern combined arms operations.

## Army Regulation Compliance and Standards

All our Army challenge coins are designed with careful attention to Army Regulation 670-1, which governs the wear and appearance of Army uniforms and insignia. Our design team understands the importance of maintaining heraldic accuracy and ensuring that unit crests, distinctive unit insignia, and other military symbols are rendered correctly according to official Army specifications and traditions.

Each coin tells a story of courage under fire, tactical proficiency, and the brotherhood of arms that defines the Army experience.

The Army's challenge coin tradition reflects the service's emphasis on unit cohesion and small unit leadership. Whether commemorating a successful deployment, recognizing exceptional performance, or honoring a retirement after decades of service, Army challenge coins serve as tangible reminders of the bonds forged in training and combat.

## Combat Arms and Support Operations Recognition

Army challenge coins recognize the full spectrum of military operations from infantry and armor to aviation and special operations. Combat arms units celebrate their warrior heritage through coins featuring crossed rifles, tank silhouettes, and airborne wings. Support units honor their critical mission through coins featuring medical crosses, transportation wheels, and logistics symbols. Each coin design reflects the unique contribution of different Army branches to overall mission success.

Whether honoring the dedication of a combat medic, recognizing the precision of an artillery crew, or celebrating the leadership of a noncommissioned officer, Army challenge coins capture the essence of soldiering and the commitment to mission accomplishment that defines Army service from the squad level to the Pentagon.
